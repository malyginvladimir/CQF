This repository contains 4 **draft** Jupyter Notebooks developed while studing for the Certificate in Quantitative Finance.
## Disclaimer ##
* Please keep in mind that the published files are *NOT* final documented scripts and well-formatted solutions. This is to protect the genuity of the submitted solutions. The motivation to publish the scripts is to help researchers to improve the performance while studying for the CQF certification and share experience. Nevertheless, the scripts are very close to the originally submitted ones.
* The files are possible solutions to the assignments and published for the **reference purpose** only. 
* I hope you refrain from copying any part of the code to pursue your CQF designation.
